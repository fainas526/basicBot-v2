Usage
-----

To get Title, Author and Formad with ID type in this in console: 
`API.getMedia().title + " | " + API.getMedia().author + " | " + API.getMedia().format + ":" + API.getMedia().cid` = Song Name | Author | format:id

Bookmark the following code. To run the bot, run the bookmark.
`javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/javascripto/basicBot-v2/master/basicBot.js');})();`

If this does not work, go to https://rawgit.com/javascripto/basicBot-v2/master/basicBot.js and copy paste its content into your console (accessible in chrome by pressing F12) when on plug.dj in your community.


Commands
--------
These can be found in [the commands file](https://github.com/javascripto/basicBot-v2/blob/master/commands.md).


Blacklists
----------
Blacklists can be added in the settings through either links to raw json files with the same format as those in the examples provided (forking and using rawgit's development link is a great way to do this), or replacing the link with a custom function that loads your lists into the bot (this option requires extensive knowledge of javascript and a good understanding of the bot's inner workings).

To update your lists manually, you can use the details specified in chat messages after a song is blacklisted, or use either of these in the console periodically:

bot.getNewBlacklistedSongs(); //get a javascript object

bot.logNewBlacklistedSongs(); //get a list
